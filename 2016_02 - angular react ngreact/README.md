# angular vs. react vs. ngreact

---
---

## angular pros

* observability feels like magic
* closer to MVC (MVVM/MVW/MV*)
* framework
* forms, routing
* plugins galore

---
---

## angular cons

* module loader feels dated
* magical
* not opinionated enough
* overlapping functionality (controllers vs. directives)
* root scope is tempting

---
---

* directive syntax
* steep learning curve
* full es6 feels out of place
* testing sucks (karma, phantom, dom etc.)

---
---

## react pros

* es6 feels good
* everything is javascript (jsx)
* no template engine
* testing is a bliss (enzyme)

---
---

## react cons

* not a framework
* no template engine (if-abuse)
* MV* vs. Von Neumann model
* immutability (or smg. similar) is a must
* html + js can end up spaghetti

---
---

## ngreact pros

* for people not satisfied with angular
* enforces isolation (unless you circumvent it)
* the V in MVC
* well defined input (and output)
* testing is still a bliss

---
---

## ngreact cons

* angular and react are far away, circumventing the isolation is tempting
* controller bloat
* no more angular plugins, considerable migration effort
* refactoring for the sake of refactoring
